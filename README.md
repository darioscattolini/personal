## Inspiration
This is the first page I developed for the IT Academy Front End Developer bootcamp.
We hadn't learned JavaScript in the bootcamp yet, so for the first version I tried 
to get the best of pure CSS while keeping the design simple, with minor JS to 
control mobile navigation menu transitions.
In October 2020 I redesigned the page, with horizontal layout and more complex
animations. I decided to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript, and therefore Gulp
to automate TS compilation.
