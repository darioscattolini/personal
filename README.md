# My personal web page
> This is the repo for my personal web page. 

## General info
This is my personal web page. I keep it simple: in a single page it displays my portfolio, my resume, some more info about myself and contact information.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS

## Status
_in progress_
* I'm working to make it responsive.
* My life still goes on.

## Inspiration
This is the first page I develop for the IT Academy Front End Developer bootcamp. No Bootstrap nor JavaScript yet, so I keep it simple with pure CSS.
