# My personal web page
> This is the repo for my personal web page. 

## General info
This is my personal web page. I keep it simple: in a single page it displays my portfolio, my resume, some more info about myself and contact information.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS (worked specially hard on absolute, sticky and fixed positioning, Flexbox, CSS variables, and responsive layout based on responsive typography)
* JavaScript (just to control mobile navigation menu transitions)

## Status
_in progress_
* I'm still working to make it fully responsive.
* My life still goes on.

## Play
This is the link to the deployed version: [https://darioscattolini.github.io/personal](https://darioscattolini.github.io/personal)

## Inspiration
This is the first page I develop for the IT Academy Front End Developer bootcamp. No Bootstrap nor JavaScript yet, so I keep it simple with pure CSS (only added minor JS feat to control mobile navigation menu transitions).
