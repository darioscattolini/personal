# My personal web page
> This is the repo for my personal web page. 

## General info
This is my personal web page. I keep it simple: in a single page it displays my portfolio, my resume, some more info about myself and contact information.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (kept to the minimum, just to control mobile navigation menu transitions)
* [Kwes](https://kwes.io/) service for form sending

## Status
_in progress_
* Still needs pic of myself for homepage
* My life still goes on.

## Access the deployed version
This is the link to the deployed version: [https://darioscattolini.github.io/personal](https://darioscattolini.github.io/personal)

## Inspiration
This is the first page I develop for the IT Academy Front End Developer bootcamp. No Bootstrap nor JavaScript in the bootcamp yet, so I tried to get the best of pure CSS while keeping the design simple. I only added minor JS feat to control mobile navigation menu transitions.
